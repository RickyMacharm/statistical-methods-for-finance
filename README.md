# statistical-methods-for-finance
This project is a synthesization of material from the course GU5261 Statistical Methods in Finance.<br/> 

I used ten assets: AAPL, AMZN, BAC, FB, GOOG, IBM, JPM, MSFT, TGT, WMT with their monthly closing prices 
from 11/1/2013 to 11/1/2018. Also, I used risk free rates from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB4WK.<br/>

Here is the agenda of the project:
* Summary
* Descriptive Statistics
* Portfolio Theory
* Asset Allocation
* Principal Component Analysis
* Risk Management
* Copulas
* Conclusion
